<h1>done<&#47;h1></p>
<h4>standup<&#47;h4></p>
<p>After a few weeks of half days, we finally had a chance to get to building robots. I got to Saint Peter's at around 1:00 to make sure all the computers were setup and working and there were kits for each team.</p>
<h4>make, make, make<&#47;h4></p>
<p>I decided to jump everyone to building the driving base, to have something to program in the upcoming weeks. I'll split off the senior teams from the junior teams if I see them get bored. For now, we're going to build the driving bases and do more servo &#47; actuation exercises before getting into sensors and logic.</p>
<h4>wrap up<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We're still leaving the library in a bit of disarray. Next week I'll have the class clean up at the 3:20 mark.</p>
<h1>todo<&#47;h1></p>
<h4>batteries<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We have rechargeable packs for each kit, but some appear to have died. I'll pick up a pack from Amazon for next session.</p>
<h4>advanced module review<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Data logging could be interesting, based on conversations that the senior engineers were having. We may want to check out the data logging modules</p>
<h1>concerns<&#47;h1></p>
<p>Next week is Thanksgiving - we're losing time to school activities and holidays. I'll need to think of extracurricular ways to have the teams interact.</p>
