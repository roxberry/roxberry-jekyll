<p>Running a robotics class for the past 3 years, I find reminding the students about G-d and the miracle of life fits perfectly. I added 2 laws to <a href="https:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov's<&#47;a> fundamental laws.</p>
<ol>
<li>Robot Makers are not G-d. We will never be able to create something as infinitely complex as G-d.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots are not replacements for humanity.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will not injure a human being or allow a human being to be harmed.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will obey our programming unless it violates law 3.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will protect its own existence, as long as this does not conflict with law 3 or 4.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
