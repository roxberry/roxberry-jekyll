<p>Professional Penetration Testing, 2nd Edition is an introduction to Penetration Testing as a career.&nbsp; The book opens with &ldquo;Ethics and Hacking&rdquo;.&nbsp; I appreciate that this was discussed early in the book.&nbsp; It served to set the tone for acceptable behavior by potential pen testers.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 discusses setting up a virtual lab and an actual hardware lab.&nbsp; The book then moves into more tactical information, Chapter 4 introduces frameworks and methodologies and their respective advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Following Chapter 4, subsequent chapters discuss reconnaissance and exploitation, internal attacks and then briefly touches on web application attacks.&nbsp; The last 2 chapters address Penetration Testing in a more formal manner and what the job of a penetration tester entails.&nbsp; Chapter 14 discusses report creation and what resources are available to communicate metrics, techniques and mitigations.&nbsp; Chapter 15 discusses how to Penetration Testing can be a long term profession, including certifications and training.</p>
