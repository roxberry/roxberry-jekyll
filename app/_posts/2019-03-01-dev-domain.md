# .DEV sites are available as of 2/28/2019

The .DEV TLD was made available for domain name registrars yesterday 2/28 and today I registered Roxberry.DEV and a few others.

According to Google, ".dev is a secure domain for developers and technology. From tools to platforms, programming languages to blogs, .dev is a home for all the interesting things that you build." from the [.dev](https://get.dev/) site.

# Benefits

* Requires HTTPS:

    "Your security is our priority. The .dev top-level domain is included on the HSTS preload list, making HTTPS required on all connections to .dev websites and pages without needing individual HSTS registration or configuration. Security is built in."

* Community

    Tools, builders, programming languages, developer blogs - .dev gives developers their very own TLD.

* Kinda cool

    First is kinda cool.
