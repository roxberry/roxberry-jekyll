# Data Architecture 

## Past and Present

1. On Prem to Cloud
1. Other Providers, not just "Big Data"
1. Interesting products like JSReports (e.g. [Ticket Generator](https://playground.jsreport.net/w/admin/ms2EkdfI))

## Case Studies

1. Cosmo DB for geographically distributed data, over 19 locations
1. Typical On Prem clients are blending and developing data strategies in the cloud.
1. Snowflake vs. SQL Server
    - Snowflake for performance
    - Snowflake cached is an order of magnitude faster than Azure SQL Server
