<h4>standup<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Another full house - I'm a little concerned that there may be too many students per kit. I'm going to work with each team to see where we need to keep kids engaged.</p>
<h4>teams<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We formed teams of 3-4 students per kit. Team names were selected, with a little bit of difficulty - committing to a team name seemed to be an issue.</p>
<h4>multimedia<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Last week, one of the senior engineers asked about a massive collaborative project. I saw this video earlier this year and showed the class this week.</p>

<h4>wrapup<&#47;h4></p>
<p>The class left the library in a bit of disarray. I'm going to need to allocate time to clean up kits.</p>
<h1>todo<&#47;h1></p>
<h4>review the laws of robotics (for Catholics) - making this a weekly exercise<&#47;h4></p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;wp.me&#47;p5BXpO-1SD">Our Laws of Robotics<&#47;a></p>
<h4>kit prep<&#47;h4></p>
<p>A couple of the donated computers did not have an OS installed. I will do this before the next session. If I'm still working from home, I'll show up earlier for the next session and get everything set up.</p>
<h4>robot designs<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We will spend time reviewing each design - I'll put it on my Surface Pro and mark it up as we discuss.</p>
<h4>inventory<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We need to know how many kits we have, how many working and non working parts. We need to test each computer - update if possible, test the USB connectors. We need to gather all the batteries and chargers and identify if we need rechargeable batteries.</p>
<h1>concerns<&#47;h1></p>
<ul>
<li>I have many new team members - hopefully enough for everyone to do. I've asked senior engineers to help with task distribution. I will make it a priority that each team has a task list (a backlog) so members can be working on some part of a project.<&#47;li>
<li>We have too much side activity - I may need to talk to the Principal about members that bring cell phones to class.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
