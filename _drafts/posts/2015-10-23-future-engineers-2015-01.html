excerpt: Today was a full house. I asked everyone to stand up for introductions. I
  asked each team member to tell me their name, why they joined the Future Engineers
  and what robot was their favorite robot. R2D2 was the clear winner with this group,
  probably most groups. I'll find a list of famous robots and show for next week.
  Most kids thought robotics was cool and would be fun.

<h4>introductions<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Today was a full house. I asked everyone to stand up for introductions. I had each team member tell me their name, why they joined the Future Engineers and what robot was their favorite robot. R2D2 was the clear winner with this group, probably most groups. I'll find a list of famous robots and show for next week. Most kids thought robotics was cool and would be fun.</p>
<h4>team<&#47;h4></p>
<p>I want to follow an application delivery team model for the elective this year. We'll have scrums, sprints, standups, retrospectives and attention to team members.  More than half of the class are new team members, I am calling them junior engineers to fit with my delivery team model. I am calling the team members that completed the modules last year senior engineers. As we move forward this year, I'd like to have the team specialize - some kids can focus on programming, some on design, some on construction, some on architecture.  The newer team members can participate in the senior team projects when they're ready.  The tricky part is managing larger teams per kit.</p>
<h4>movie<&#47;h4></p>
<p>I cobbled together my A&#47;V unit (my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoftstore.com&#47;store&#47;msusa&#47;en_US&#47;pdp&#47;Surface-Pro-3&#47;productID.300190600">Surface Pro 3<&#47;a>, my <a href="https:&#47;&#47;jawbone.com&#47;speakers&#47;minijambox">Mini Jambox<&#47;a>, and the library computer 24" monitor) and showed the team a history of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lego.com&#47;en-us&#47;mindstorms&#47;videos&#47;15-years-of-lego-mindstorms-3e8fa0444f654438a4d46f7ba8660624">Mindstorms Robotics<&#47;a>.</p>
<h4>kits<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We reviewed the elements of a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;shop.education.lego.com&#47;legoed&#47;en-US&#47;education&#47;LEGO-MINDSTORMS-Education-NXT&#47;NXT-Base-Set&#47;5003402&amp;isSimpleSearch=false">Mindstorms NXT Education Base Kit<&#47;a>. I had the senior team review each part - the Controller, aka the Brick, the IR sensor, the Sound sensor, the Light sensor, the Color sensor and the Servos, aka the Motors. This gave me a chance to talk about some of the applied concepts that we deal with in robotics, e.g. IR measuring distance by beam response. I also talked about how we actually applied the pi constant last year to determine distance and the number of rotations needed by the servo to reach that distance. It was cool to see the kids "get it" as it was actually putting their math to use.</p>
<h4>demos<&#47;h4></p>
<p>I broke out a couple of robots to work with - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;dp&#47;B00CWER3XY&#47;?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=75005897359&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=12014983471789292828&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_1y6ynnxbrh_b">Mindstorms EVE<&#47;a>, <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.kickstarter.com&#47;projects&#47;1158090852&#47;pi-bot-the-next-great-tool-in-robotics-learning-pl">PiBot<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dexterindustries.com&#47;gopigo&#47;">GoPiGo<&#47;a>. I also showed my wiring and electronics tools - not that we'll use them this year, but at least expose the team to the idea.</p>
<h4>wrapup<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Wrapping up today's session - I assigned action items to each team member:<br />
* Get a Notebook for designs, doodling, mindmapping - we will discuss this next week<br />
* Come up with a robot that solves a problem and draw it in the notebook - I want to talk about these ideas and the constraints we have with technology and environment</p>
<h1>todo<&#47;h1></p>
<h4>review the laws of robotics (for Catholics)<&#47;h4></p>
<ol>
<li>Robot Makers are not G-d. We will never be able to create something as infinitely complex as G-d.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots are not replacements for humanity.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will not injure a human being or allow a human being to be harmed.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will obey our programming unless it violates law 3.<&#47;li>
<li>Robots we create will protect its own existence, as long as this does not conflict with law 3 or 4.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>Laws 3, 4 and 5 are from Isaac Asimov's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;I-Robot-The-Series&#47;dp&#47;0553294385">I, Robot<&#47;a></p>
<h4>notebook check<&#47;h4></p>
<p>I'm undecided if I will send team members home who do not have a notebook. I think it is an important and simple tool. I'll see how it plays out.</p>
<h4>robot designs<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We will spend time reviewing each design - I'll put it on my Surface Pro and mark it up as we discuss.</p>
<h4>teams and team names<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Based on the number of kids that show up next week and the number of kits, we'll create teams.  Each team will pick a name.</p>
<h4>inventory<&#47;h4></p>
<p>We need to know how many kits we have, how many working and non working parts.  We need to test each computer - update if possible, test the USB connectors. We need to gather all the batteries and chargers and identify if we need rechargeable batteries.</p>
<h1>concerns<&#47;h1></p>
<ul>
<li>I have many new team members - hopefully enough for everyone to do. I've asked senior engineers to help with task distribution. I will make it a priority that each team has a task list (a backlog) so members can be working on some part of a project.<&#47;li>
<li>We have too much side activity - I may need to talk to the Principal about members that bring cell phones to class.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
