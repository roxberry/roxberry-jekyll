<h2>Blog ideas in the works<&#47;h2><br />
So this is a range of ideas that I have for writing. &nbsp;I'm a geek, my thing is technology, security and making lives better and safer. &nbsp;Posts may or may never be published based on my work and life schedule, but I sure hope to get something out there. &nbsp;If something is interesting, comment and let me know.</p>
<h3>New Tools<&#47;h3><br />
Tools are my bread and butter - I demand the best tools or I make my own. &nbsp;What do I use daily that&nbsp;maybe I should document how I use it? What new tool looks like it could be useful to build hardware? What tool is just a pain to use? &nbsp;What tools have I created to help me solve something that something off the shelf could not solve? &nbsp;There's a wealth of information just living in my toolbox.</p>
<h3>CYA<&#47;h3><br />
Cover your assets - or in other words how to apply security to every day projects and living. &nbsp;I like security, it's something I do and it's something I like to think about. &nbsp;Future posts will cover trends, topics, screw ups and generally interesting subject matter related to security. &nbsp;Breaking stuff is cool too - I may venture into ways to use hacking to help overcome technology limitations (the real meaning of hacking, IMHO).</p>
<h3>Consumer Robotics<&#47;h3><br />
Robotics is fun for me - I teach, I code, I make. &nbsp;Robotics is a way to have a tactile experience beyond the IDE and it's awesome to make your own minions. &nbsp;I should write more about the stuff that I'm doing in the robotics space.</p>
<h3>Distributed Infrastructure<&#47;h3><br />
A.k.a. "The Cloud" - I'm working on research related to cloud security. &nbsp;I think we're still figuring out how to coexist with systems that are outside of our physical reach. How do we deal with IoT issues - what are the new challenges of living in an IoT enabled ecosystem?</p>
<h3>Interesting Companies<&#47;h3><br />
Every couple of posts I will focus on a company doing interesting things using technology. &nbsp;I'll highlight small to enormous as long as there is something of use and interesting.</p>
<h3><&#47;h3></p>
<h3>Motivators<&#47;h3><br />
How do I write? How am I building this website? How do I&nbsp;make money online? I have no idea :)&nbsp;- but maybe spitballing ideas on my blog will help concentrate my focus on a few areas that could be profitable.</p>
<h3>Spare Parts<&#47;h3><br />
The name of this post is "spare parts" - nothing really focused. Posts can cover bits and pieces of the past couple of weeks and forecasts for the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;Expect no continuity or consistency other than this is the stuff that caught my attention, my shiny red buttons.</p>
