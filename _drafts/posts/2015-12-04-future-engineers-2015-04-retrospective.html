<h1>done<&#47;h1></p>
<h4>TOBI Project<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Showed the class the TOBI Project video, imho, a great example of robotics helping, not replacing humanity through telepresence applications<br />

<h4>batteries<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Charged a few in class, loaded up a few controllers with AAs. We should be good for the short term.</p>
<h4>make, make, make - part deux<&#47;h4></p>
<p>Lots of moving robots today! Teams built their mobile bases and the robots started moving. We're moving forward, pun intended.</p>
<h1>todo<&#47;h1></p>
<p>Review the calendar, think about independent projects.</p>
<h1>concerns<&#47;h1></p>
<p>We have a few engineers as no shows 4 or so. Probably a good thing as we have limited resources and smaller team sizes are much more productive. I think the time between sessions, the overcrowding to a degree, the elective status and the time of the class (Friday afternoon) has an effect on attendance.</p>
