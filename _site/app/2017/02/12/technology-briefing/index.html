<h1 id="farmland">Farmland</h1>
<p>I started last week at a new client out in the farm lands of Pennsylvania.  Out of my comfort zone, this involved a hotel stay at the Inn at Leolas, a new client with a barrage of new concepts and code.  I was issued a new laptop, new e-mail, new MSDN account - more stuff to manage.  I did utilize a Google Chrome feature of setting up a Chrome profile for the new account.  This let me setup a profile with bookmarks, applications and settings specific to the account I will use at the client.</p>

<h1 id="performance-testing">Performance Testing</h1>
<p>I am following a basic process for performance testing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand client issues that prompted their request for a specialist.</li>
  <li>Identify target environments to test</li>
  <li>Create test environment to plan and design tests</li>
  <li>Plan and design tests</li>
  <li>Execute tests and capture results</li>
  <li>Analyze results</li>
  <li>Write report, include approach, results and recommendations</li>
  <li>Present findings and recommendations</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="command">Command</h1>
<p>I started a project for a server to run on my robot kits using <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo/">GoPiGo</a> as a prototype.  Find it on Github, <a href="https://github.com/roxberry/command">command</a>.  I ran into issues with the node-gopigo module, may need to write an interface and stub it out to work on the services code off robot.</p>

<p>I was approved and registered to go to <a href="http://events.secureworldexpo.com/details/philadelphia-pa-2017/">SecureWorld Philadelphia</a> in April.  I also signed up for the “Designing and Building a Cybersecurity Program Based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework” training option.  While <a href="http://www.waveseeker.com/DSI/">Database Solutions</a> may not directly implement a Cybersecurity framework, I consider it critical that we understand what our clients are building.</p>
