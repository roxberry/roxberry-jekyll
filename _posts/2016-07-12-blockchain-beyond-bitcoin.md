I'm doing a run down of available blockchain implementations - here's a blog post of blockchain for other purposes 

[C24 Blog](https://blog.c24tech.com/data-geek/building-on-blockchain-part-one-from-database-to-blockchain)

>Building on Blockchain Part One: From Database to Blockchains
In this series of blog posts we'll look at how we're helping clients evolve their existing systems to support distributed ledgers and related technologies.

We're going to need to parse out the blockchain cryptographic process (I'm reading up on that also), but I figure analyzing implementations would be helpful
